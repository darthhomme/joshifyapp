Hello! This is a MongoDB, Express, Angular, Node.js application.

Angular is a powerful front end framework that is typically used for consumer-service pattern sites.
MongoDB allows the developer to make changes to the database schema without having to make migrations.
Express and Node allows for exportation of modules and for the viewing of applications outside of the browser.

My MEAN application allows the user to add notices for reminders he can later come back to.

The app itself is divided into two portions: The client side and the server side. In the latter, I made a backend API, <a href="https://whispering-tundra-71237.herokuapp.com/api/notices">/api/notices</a> to which I'll be posting notices data. On the front end goes my controller, angular module, and CSS

Here is the <a href="https://whispering-tundra-71237.herokuapp.com/">awesome link</a> to my app.
